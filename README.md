# PatternRecognition

This repository was used for Pattern Recognition Coursework 2019. 
The repository includes the final report produced, the scripts used to perform the experiments, and the results that were obtained following the experiments. 

Standard python files were used for all the experiments, using Python 3.6+.

The scripts are found in the 'Scripts' folder and are labelled as 'ExperimentName_ParameterAdjusted'.
Most of these scripts are baseline scripts, and modifications made to obtain certain plots may not have been included.

The results are located in the 'QuestionX Results', with the exception for split=0.2 pics. This folder contains the results for the first question with regards to PCA, using a split of 0.2
